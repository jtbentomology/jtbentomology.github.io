## Research Overview

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in agricultural entomology jointly at the University of California-Berkeley, stationed at the Kearney Research and Extension Center in Parlier, California. My research integrates classical biological control, integrated pest management (IPM), and applied agroecology to address economically significant pests in a variety of crop systems from California’s Central Valley to the Southeast United States.

My current program is organized around two complementary research priorities. The first focuses on the classical biological control of spotted-wing drosophila (*Drosophila suzukii*), one of the most destructive invasive pests of soft-skinned fruit worldwide. This work evaluates the host range, performance, and field establishment potential of the larval parasitoid *Ganaspis kimorum* as a  biocontrol agent, to develop durable, ecologically grounded suppression strategies for California and the Pacific Coast region.

The second priority targets vine mealybug (*Planococcus ficus*) management in commercial wine grape systems, with an emphasis on optimizing insecticide programs optimized for California's Central Coast and the Central Valley. This includes comparative evaluation of foliar versus drip-applied chemistries, application timing and intervals, and emerging mating disruption solutions within integrated management frameworks.

I am driven by a commitment to scalable, biologically relevant pest management strategies where chemistry is used responsibly and in concert with biological rational management solutions to sustain agroecosystem function and long-term grower profitability.
