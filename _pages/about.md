## Research Overview

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in agricultural entomology jointly affiliated with the **University of California, Berkeley** and the **USDA-ARS / UCANR Kearney Research and Extension Center** in Parlier, California. My research program integrates classical biological control, integrated pest management (IPM), and applied agroecology to address the challenges posed by economically significant invertebrate pests in specialty crop systems throughout California's Central Valley and broader production regions.

My current work centers on two interconnected research priorities. The first concerns the classical biological control of **spotted-wing drosophila** (*Drosophila suzukii*; Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive vinegar fly that represents one of the most damaging pests of soft-skinned fruit globally. I am investigating the host-range, efficacy, and field establishment of the larval parasitoid *Ganaspis kimorum* as a candidate biocontrol agent, with the goal of contributing toward a durable, ecologically sound suppression strategy for this pest in California and the Pacific Coast region. The second priority involves developing and evaluating **insecticide management strategies for vine mealybug** (*Planococcus ficus*; Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in commercial wine grape production, with a particular emphasis on comparing foliar and drip-applied chemistries, application intervals, and novel active ingredients under Central Valley field conditions.

Broadly, my scholarship is animated by a commitment to developing pest management solutions that are effective across conventional, organic, and naturalized cropping systems — reducing reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides while preserving agroecosystem function and grower profitability.

## Academic Background

I received my **Ph.D. in Entomology** (2024) from the **University of Florida**, Gainesville, where my dissertation — conducted under the supervision of Dr. Oscar Liburd — provided a comprehensive ecological evaluation of *D. suzukii* population dynamics and management across conventional, organic, and natural land management systems, with direct implications for IPM decision-making frameworks. Prior to that, I completed my **M.S. in Entomology** (2019) at the University of Florida under Dr. Dan Hahn, examining the association between lipid energy stores and diapause genotype in European corn borer (*Ostrinia nubilalis*). I hold a **B.S. in Biological Sciences** (2010) from the **University of Maryland, College Park**.

During my graduate training, I also served as a **Student Trainee in the USDA-ARS Pathways Internship Program** (2016–2019), gaining extensive experience in applied agricultural research, field experimental design, and interagency scientific collaboration.

## Selected Funding & Recognition

My research has been supported by the **University of Florida Provost Steinmetz Endowment** ($115,941; 2020–2024) and the **USDA-ARS Pathways Internship Program** ($83,625; 2016–2019). I am a **2026–2027 Science Policy Fellow** with the Entomological Society of America, a position that supports engagement with the federal legislative process on issues pertaining to agricultural research, pest management policy, and food security. I have also received competitive travel and research awards from the Entomological Society of America's Southeastern Branch and the University of Florida.

## Science Communication & Mentorship

I maintain an active commitment to scientific outreach, undergraduate mentorship, and diversity in STEM. I have directly mentored **sixteen undergraduate students** — eleven in conservation education and five in laboratory research — across projects spanning parasitoid bioassay design, analytical chemistry, and molecular techniques. I have served as a panelist and speaker at numerous career development and diversity-focused events, and I co-created and led the **Make it Count Peer Mentoring Program** at the University of Florida. I also served as Vice President of the **Pride Community Center of North Central Florida** from 2020 to 2023.
